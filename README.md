# packettracer-network1
## Notes
A network that I created in Cisco Packet Tracer to test different configurations, security controls, and Cisco technologies across a wide-area network.

N.B - There seems to be a bug with the network address translation (NAT) on the Cisco ASA 5506x in Packet Tracer version 8.2.2.

## Usage
Download the file and open within Cisco Packet Tracer, from here you can simulate the network.

## Disclaimer

You are free to use this network as you wish but it is mandatory to give me credit when using it.
