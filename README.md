# packettracer-network1
## Notes
A network that I created in Cisco Packet Tracer to test different configurations, security controls, and Cisco technologies across a wide-area network. Built in line with Cisco's Layer 2 and Layer 3 security best practices including access control lists (ACL), Secure Shell (SSH) remote management, encryption of communication and more. Utilised technologies between Layer 1 and Layer 3 of the Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI).

## Usage
Download the file and open within Cisco Packet Tracer, from here you can simulate the network.

## Disclaimer

N.B - There seems to be a bug with the network address translation (NAT) on the Cisco ASA 5506x when using Dynamic NAT from a singular private IP to the EXTERNAL assigned IP address in Packet Tracer version 8.2.2. ANY COMMENTS ON THIS ARE WELCOME.


This network is by no means complete. Further development is required around virtual local area network (VLAN) and dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) setup.

You are free to use this network as you wish but it is mandatory to give me credit when using it.
